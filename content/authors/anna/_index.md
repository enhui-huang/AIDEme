# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a statistician with broad interest in nonparametric and semiparametric modeling, computation, statistical learning, and applications. The central theme of my methodology research is to build models that utilize domain knowledge and are exible with minimum assumptions. For nonparametric and semiparametric modeling, I am particularly drawn toward splines, kernel machines and mixed model based approaches. For statistical learning, my focus is on design of learning algorithms and data processing methods related to databases. My methodology research is intertwined with my applied interests through collaborations with scientists from a variety of disciplines.

- Nonparametric and Semiparametric Modeling
- Statistical Learning
- Interactive data exploration and active learning
